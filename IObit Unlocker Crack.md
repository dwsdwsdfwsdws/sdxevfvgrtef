## How it works:

It identifies the program or process that is holding the file/folder and can either gently prompt the program to release the file/folder or, in forced mode, terminate the process, freeing up the resource. 


## Alternatives:

Other programs like Revo Uninstaller or Advanced Uninstaller also offer similar functionalities for removing or unlocking stubborn files and folders.
